					<h3>Proof of Concept</h3>
					<h2>Progressive Web App</h2>
					<p>By Hui Yee Tan</p>
				</section>

				<section class="overview">
					<section class="introduction">
						<h3>Progressive Web App (PWA)</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Use modern web capabilities to deliver fast, engaging and reliable mobile web experience</li>
							<li>Neutral to most operating system but dependent to the browser used as it is website based</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section class="features">
						<h3>Features</h3>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">Work Offline</li>	<!--<span class="fragments"></span>-->
							<li class="fragment">Response relatively faster by serving pages from cache storage</li>
							<li class="fragment">Use device features such as Microphone, Camera, Location and Background Sync</li>
							<li class="fragment">Send notifications to subscribers</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							introduce service worker first next page before running the demo part

						<h3>Introducing Service Worker</h3>
						<img width="1206" height="250" data-src="./img/downasaur.PNG" alt="downasaur page">
					</section>
					<section data-transition="convex">
						<h3>Service Worker</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Service Worker manages how network requests from and to your application are handled</li>
							<li>Runs separately from main browser thread in the background, and independent to your web application</li>
							<li>Enhance user experience</li>
						</ul>	
						<aside class="notes">
							An extra layer between your app and server, and preprocessing the data from app and server before sending to their destination
							<ul>
								<li>
										For example, provide a fallback page or display if user went offline and the destination page is not cached. 
										return a mock response if user went offline as you only want to show live data, but you don't want the page to go downasaur 
								</li>
								<li>
									Remember to provide fallback options for browsers that does not support serviceworker or features provided
									e.g. polyfills
								</li>
								<li>
										Show both demo to audience. First two show using hesta website served from local. Last two use my poc website.
										Remember to subscribe first. then perform location, camera and backgroundsync accordingly
								</li>
							</ul>

						<img width="500px" height="500px" data-src="./img/sw-lifecycle.png" alt="serviceworker lifecycle">
						<p>Lifecycle of the service worker</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							<ul>
								<li>install - add static pages to cache</li>
								<li>activated - until this step is performed, the sw will not control the web app</li>
								<li>idle - if the sw is not in use (e.g user didn't use the app to perform any action)</li>
								<li>fetch - when network request is made from the app</li>
								<li>terminated - save memory</li>
							</ul>

				<section data-transition="slide" class="business-benefits">
					<h3>Business Benefits of PWA</h3>
					<ol>
						<li>Enhance user experience</li>
						<li>Reduce network traffic from and to the server</li>
						<li>App can be installed by user, and hence increases user interactions</li>
					</ol>
					<aside>background sync, notification</aside>
				</section>

				<section data-transition="convex">
					<section class="limitations">
						<h3>Limitations</h3>
						<ol>
							<li>
								Service worker will only be ready after the first page first loads.
							</li>
							<li>
								Service worker will be in terminated state when it is not in used. 
							</li>
							<li>IndexedDB and localStorage has size limits</li>
							<li>Only runs over HTTPS or localhost to prevent man-in-the-middle attack</li>
						</ol>
						<aside class="notes">
							<ul>
								Any data that receives before activation will not be cached unless specifically handled.
								<li>Installation - Precache static files</li>
								<li>Activation - After the service worker takes control of the application</li>
								<br/>
								We cannot rely on the app's global state persisting between events.
								(Workaround: use IndexedDB)
							</ul>
							consider to cache the files that is important only (static files)
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section class="challenges">
						<h3>Challenges</h3>
						<aside class="notes">
							<ul>
								<li>Hard to write test that reflects the real behaviour of browsers. Introduce Lighthouse</li>
								<li>Webpack Configuration and Project Compilation takes a lot of my time (new to webpack)</li>
								<li>Typescript - sw needs different tsconfig.json file as its library has conflicts with DOM library</li>
							</ul>
